HTML Tools
==========

This Addon for Komodo Edit/IDE simplifies some of the processing of hand-coding HTML.
The various tools either replace selected text with HTML code which would be more tedious to type or, in some cases, inserts snippets of HTML.

There are also some additional tools to help with setting up pages and some common preferences.

You can download the latest version [here](http://komodoide.com/resources/addons/manngo--htmltools) …



Tools Include:

* Instant HTML
	* Convert Selected Text to HTML Structure

The addon adds a menu to your main menu bar, from which the above tools are selected.

The first Menu Item, About HTML Tools …, contains a detailed summary on the use of each tool.

Note the version number: 0.3.3b. The addon works, but there may be some rough edges.

In particular:

* The Icons need work. (Contributions would be very welcome)
* The HTML5 conversion works, but makes a bit of a mess of the layout.
* Pre-Process CSS is in its early stages.
* HTML Templates is also at a very early stage, and the syntax is very much under consideration.
* The Quick Web Setup works. This includes setting up preffered languages. However, they will not appear correctly until after a restart.
* Copy to Clipboard may not work reliably

Future plans include adding form tools, css tools, some snippets and more work on the CSS pre processor and HTML templates.

This addon does what it does, and doesn’t do what it doesn’t do.
Everything else is a bonus.

I use this addon regularly in my own work, and subjected all of my students to it, with success.

I hope that you will also find it useful in website development.
