{"name":"Html-tools","tagline":"Komodo Addon to help with HTML Coding.","body":"HTML Tools\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThis Addon for Komodo Edit/IDE simplifies some of the processing of hand-coding HTML.\r\nThe various tools either replace selected text with HTML code which would be more tedious to type or, in some cases, inserts snippets of HTML.\r\n\r\nThere are also some additional tools to help with setting up pages and some common preferences.\r\n\r\nTools Include:\r\n\r\n* Instant HTML\r\n\t* Convert Selected Text to HTML Structure\r\n\t* Convert Text to Paragraphs & Elements\r\n\t* Convert Text to Unordered, Ordered & Definition Lists\r\n\t* Convert Text to Tables\r\n\t* Insert a Local Image\r\n\t* Convert Text to HTML Anchors\r\n\t* Wrap Selected Text inside an HTML Container Element\r\n\t* Insert HTML Element\r\n\t* Insert a CSS Link or JavaScript Link\r\n\t* Insert an Anchor\r\n* Convert Selected Text\r\n\t* Convert Text to HTML Entities\r\n\t* Convert \"straight\" quotes to “smart” quotes\r\n\t* Convert text to a JavaScript Array Literal\r\n\t* Convert CSS Colour betwen RGB & #rrggbb notation\r\n* Document\r\n\t* Fix Tabs & UTF 8 settings\r\n\t* Convert Document to HTML5\r\n\t* Simple CSS Pre-Processor\r\n\t* Generate HTML Structure from Indented Text\r\n    Use HTML File as a Template\r\n* Beautify (thanks to http://jsbeautifier.org)\r\n\t* Beautify JavaScript\r\n\t* Beautify HTML\r\n\t* Beautify CSS\r\n* Quick Web Preferences\r\n\r\nThe addon adds a menu to your main menu bar, from which the above tools are selected.\r\n\r\nThe first Menu Item, About HTML Tools …, contains a detailed summary on the use of each tool.\r\n\r\nNote the version number: 0.3.3b. The addon works, but there may be some rough edges.\r\n\r\nIn particular:\r\n\r\n* The Icons need work. (Contributions would be very welcome)\r\n* The HTML5 conversion works, but makes a bit of a mess of the layout.\r\n* Pre-Process CSS is in its early stages.\r\n* HTML Templates is also at a very early stage, and the syntax is very much under consideration.\r\n* The Quick Web Setup works. This includes setting up preffered languages. However, they will not appear correctly until after a restart.\r\n* Copy to Clipboard may not work reliably\r\n\r\nFuture plans include adding form tools, css tools, some snippets and more work on the CSS pre processor and HTML templates.\r\n\r\nDiscalimer\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis addon does what it does, and doesn’t do what it doesn’t do.\r\nEverything else is a bonus.\r\n\r\nI use this addon regularly in my own work, and subjected all of my students to it, with success.\r\n\r\nI hope that you will also find it useful in website development.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
